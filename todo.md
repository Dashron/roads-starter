# Roads-Starter: TODO
0. Find a standard way of grabbing invalid parameter errors and parsing those in the handlebars file, so that it highlights problem fields.
1. Wrap up the public POST to /profile, and ensure that profile editing works with standard form edit through HTML, or with the PJAX override client side.
2. Move db connection out of the api constructor, and into something that can be injected
3. Maybe rethink the project idea? This feels convoluted. Maybe we can take the user routes out and into a different file, or even different package.
4. Get a roads github project set up, and maybe a roads npm org too.
5. Flush commit history and reset from a clean start to kill any old keys
