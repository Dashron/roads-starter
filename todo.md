# Roads-Starter: TODO
0. Get everything working again
- Ensure single user api is working
- Add multi user
- Get web working
1. Get a basic template in place using bootstrap (prove bootstrap is working)
2. Get login and signup working and verified
3. Maybe make it it's own package that dashron and dmdashboard can depend on?
4. Start building dmdashboard in new system
5. Eventually migrate dashron2 to it
