# Roads-Starter: TODO
0. Test that the new auth system properly forwards the auth cookie
0.2. Ensure that auth works with browserified clients
0.3. Ensure that we get proper responses and status codes for bad paths, unauth'd access, auth'd access
0.9. Ensure all console logs are using the logger instead. Figure out how to get access to logger all over the place
1. Flush commit history and reset from a clean start
2. Build new site
3. Migrate personal site
?. Move the buildClient stuff into roads starter? It seems like a better place.
